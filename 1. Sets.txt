1. Sets
Q1.
Let 
A={1,2,3,4,5,6} and R={(x,y)∈A×A∣lcm(x,y)=12}.
Find 
𝑅 and determine whether it is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.

Q2.
A class of 100 students study at least one of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.
Number of students studying exactly two subjects is 30,
and the number of students studying all three is 10.
If the number studying Physics only is 25 and Chemistry only is 20,
find the number of students studying Mathematics only.

Q3.
Let 
U=R, 
A={x∣x^2−3x+2=0}, 
B={x∣x^2−5x+6=0}, 
C={x∣x^2−7x+12=0}.
Find 
(A∪B)∩C and draw a Venn diagram.
 
Q4.
Let 
A=Z, and define 
R by
aRb⟺a−b is divisible by 7
Prove that 
R is an equivalence relation and write its equivalence classes for the set 
{1,2,…,15}.

Q5.
Let 
A={1,2,3,4,5,6} and 
R={(a,b)∣a+b=7}.
Check if 
R is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.

Q6.
The set 
A={1,2,3,…,10} is partitioned into equivalence classes by the relation
aRb⟺gcd(a,b)=1.
Find the equivalence classes of
R.

3. Functions
Q7.

f is strictly increasing in some interval of 
R and strictly decreasing in another.
